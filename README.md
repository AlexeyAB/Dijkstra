Dijkstra
========

Find the shortest path using Dijkstra algorithm

Source code requires Qt >= 4.8.4 & C++ (MSVS2010)_MSC_VER >= 1600 or GCC >= 4.7.2

Visualization by using OpenGL (Qt GLWidget).

GUI-application that generate the walls on the 2D map and trying to find the shortest path from the start position (0, 0) to the end postiton (MAX, MAX) bypassing the walls.
